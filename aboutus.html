        <p>My name is Amber Anderson! I am a student in the Global MS BAIS program at USF. I am currently taking Dr. Clinton Daniel's class, ISM-6155.
            A little bit about me: last year, I graduated from UF with my BA in Economics as well as English, hence the photo. I am from Clearwater Florida, and I live here now. I currently work as a buyer for Leonardo DRS. 
        </p>I developed this website as part of an assignment to practice building interactive, data-driven websites. I
            utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and functional user interface.
